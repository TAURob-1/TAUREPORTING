---

## Side-by-Side Allocation

| Channel | Mediacom % | TAU % | Difference | Why TAU Is Better |
|---------|-----------|-------|------------|-------------------|
| **YouTube CTV** | 28.6% | 15.0% | -13.6% | CTV = scale, not hero; mobile-first means mobile platforms prioritized |
| **ITVX** | 19.0% | 10.0% | -9.0% | BVOD efficiency, not overweight; targeting precision matters more than reach |
| **Channel 4 CTV** | 15.5% | 10.0% | -5.5% | Young demo fit, but not at expense of mobile platforms |
| **Sky AdSmart** | 8.3% | 0% | -8.3% | Reallocated to Twitch + Spotify (better demo/context fit) |
| **Netflix** | 4.8% | 0% | -4.8% | Unconfirmed inventory = unreliable; moved to testing budget |
| **TikTok** | 6.0% | **18.0%** | **+12.0%** | #1 platform Age 25-34, gaming vertical, mobile-native |
| **Meta** | 7.1% | **15.0%** | **+7.9%** | Instagram Reels + Facebook gaming groups = mobile-first |
| **Twitch** | 0% | **5.0%** | **+5.0%** | Gaming affinity, live streaming, slots content adjacency |
| **Programmatic** | 6.0% | 10.0% | +4.0% | Retargeting + MSOA geo-fencing (not just generic prospecting) |
| **Spotify/Audio** | 4.8% | 5.0% | +0.2% | Mobile moments, commuting, passive listening |
| **Testing Budget** | **0%** | **10.0%** | **+10.0%** | Creative/channel/geo validation BEFORE £4.2M spend |
| **Contingency** | 0% | 2.0% | +2.0% | Real-time optimization, scale winners |

## Key Differences

### **Mediacom: 71.4% CTV** (YouTube, ITVX, C4, Sky, Netflix)
- **Problem:** CTV = lean-back, living room, not mobile-first
- **Target mismatch:** "Spin Masters" are on phones, not smart TVs
- **Risk:** Single format concentration (if CTV underperforms, campaign fails)

### **TAU: 35% CTV** (YouTube 15%, ITVX 10%, C4 10%)
- **Why:** CTV for scale, not entire strategy
- **Mobile-first:** 38% on TikTok (18%) + Meta (15%) + Twitch (5%)
- **Diversification:** No channel >18%, no format >40%

## Mobile-First Comparison

| Metric | Mediacom | TAU | Impact |
|--------|----------|-----|--------|
| **Mobile Platforms** (TikTok + Meta + Twitch) | 13.1% | **38.0%** | +24.9% = £1.05M more on mobile |
| **CTV Platforms** | 71.4% | 35.0% | -36.4% = Right-sized for scale, not dominance |
| **Testing Budget** | 0% | 10.0% | £420K to validate before scaling |

**For "mobile-first Spin Masters":**
- Mediacom spends **71% where target isn't** (CTV)
- TAU spends **38% where target is** (mobile platforms)
