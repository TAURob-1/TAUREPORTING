Targeting Precision (All Channels):
- Age: 25-44 (not vague "18+" or "18-34")
- Income: £30-60K (disposable income for gaming)
- Geography: 500 high-propensity MSOAs (20-30% CPM reduction vs national)
- Behavioral: Gaming content viewers, competitor app users, existing player lookalikes
- Daypart: Mobile = lunch (12-2pm), commute (7-9am/5-7pm), evening (8-11pm)
- Frequency: 3-5 exposures optimal (capped at 7 to avoid fatigue)

Performance Framework:
- Target CPA: £254 (41K NDPs = £4.2M budget / 41K target)
- Attribution: Multi-touch, 30-day window, view-through + click-through
- Incrementality: 10% MSOA holdout for lift testing
- Creative Testing: 10 variants March 1-27, kill bottom 5, scale top 5 in April
- Channel Optimization: Weekly CPA review, reallocate from >£300 CPA to <£200 CPA channels
- Geo Strategy: Month 1 = 500 MSOAs, Month 2 = expand 1,000 MSOAs if CPA <£250, Month 3 = national if CPA holds

Why This Beats Mediacom's Plan:
1. Mobile-first (33% TikTok+Meta vs 13% Mediacom) = reaches "Spin Masters" where they are
2. Testing budget (10% = £420K) = validates before scaling, not assumes
3. Precision targeting (Age 25-44, income, MSOA, lookalike) vs vague "Adults 18+"
4. Diversification (no channel >18%, no format >40%) vs Mediacom 71% CTV concentration
5. Data leverage (175K existing players for lookalike) vs generic interest targeting
6. Platform mix (includes Twitch, Spotify) vs Mediacom missing mobile-native platforms
7. Performance accountability (CPA targets, weekly optimization) vs reach metrics only
8. Geo strategy (500 MSOA concentration) vs national spray-and-pray
