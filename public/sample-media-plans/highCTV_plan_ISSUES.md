# highCTV_plan.csv - What Makes This a "Bad" Agency Response

## The Brief Said:
- **Target:** "Spin Masters" (Age 25-44, mobile-first gaming enthusiasts)
- **No Linear TV** (budget constraints, wrong demo)
- **Mobile-first approach** (where target spends time)

## What Mediacom Delivered:
- **71.4% CTV** (YouTube, ITVX, C4, Sky = £3M of £4.2M)
- **Only 13.1% Social** (TikTok 6%, Meta 7.1% = £550K total)
- **Vague targeting** ("Adults 18+", "Age 18-34")
- **Risk-averse language** ("brand-safe", "premium inventory", "pending review")

---

## 🚨 Critical Issues an AI Audit Would Flag:

### 1. **Platform Mismatch for Target Audience**
**Problem:** 71.4% on CTV (living room, lean-back) for "mobile-first" audience
- YouTube CTV: £1.2M (28.6%) - CTV users ≠ mobile gamers
- ITVX + C4: £1.45M (34.5%) - Catch-up TV viewers, not mobile-native

**Reality:** "Spin Masters" are on phones (TikTok, Instagram, mobile YouTube), not smart TVs

**Should Be:** 
- YouTube CTV: 15% (£630K) - Not zero, but not hero
- Mobile-first (TikTok + Meta + Mobile YouTube): 40% (£1.68M)

---

### 2. **Massive Under-Allocation to Mobile Platforms**
**Problem:** TikTok (£250K = 6%) and Meta (£300K = 7.1%) criminally low

**Data Reality:**
- **TikTok:** 18M UK users, Age 18-34 = 65%, gaming vertical HUGE (slots content, big wins, streamers)
- **Meta:** Instagram Reels = TikTok competitor, Facebook gaming groups 5M+ UK members
- **"Spin Masters" media diet:** 2-3 hrs/day on TikTok/Instagram, 30 min on CTV

**Should Be:**
- TikTok: 18% (£750K) - Top View + In-Feed + Spark Ads
- Meta: 15% (£630K) - Reels + Stories + Feed (Instagram heavy)
- Combined: 33% mobile-first vs 13.1% in this plan

**Impact:** Missing 60%+ of target audience's media time

---

### 3. **"Brand Safety" as Excuse for Conservatism**
**Mediacom Language:** 
- "Brand-safe environment" (YouTube CTV)
- "Quality content adjacency" (ITVX)
- "Social media allocation conservative pending brand safety review"

**Translation:** "We're scared of TikTok/Meta because they're new and we can't control them like TV"

**Reality:**
- TikTok has brand safety controls (category blocking, whitelist/blacklist)
- Meta has 15+ years of gaming advertiser experience
- Tombola is a gambling brand - "brand safety" ≠ avoid platforms, it = use targeting

**Red Flag:** Using "brand safety" to justify comfortable (CTV) over effective (mobile)

---

### 4. **Vague Targeting Specs**
**Examples:**
- "Adults 18+" (YouTube CTV) = 52M people, useless
- "Age 18-34" (TikTok) = half the platform, not precision
- "Gaming interests" (Meta) = what games? Casino? Console? Mobile?
- "Behavioral targeting" (Programmatic) = which behaviors?

**Missing:**
- Gaming affinity signals (competitor app users, casino content viewers, slots streamers)
- Lookalike from 175K existing Arcade players (Tombola has this data!)
- MSOA geographic concentration (500 high-propensity markets)
- Daypart/context (mobile gaming = lunch breaks, commutes, evenings)

**Should Include:**
- "YouTube Mobile: Gaming content viewers (slots channels, casino streamers, big win compilations), competitor title viewers (Sky Vegas, 888 Casino ads)"
- "TikTok: Lookalike from top 20% Arcade players, gaming vertical, slots hashtag engagers, Age 25-44 (not 18-34)"
- "Meta: Custom audience from 175K existing players, lookalike 1-3%, Instagram Reels placement priority, gaming interest + disposable income £30K+"

---

### 5. **Netflix Placeholder (4.8% = £200K "TBC")**
**Problem:** Allocating £200K to "maybe" inventory

**Quote:** "Netflix (when available) - awaiting confirmation"

**Why This Is Bad:**
- Netflix UK ad tier launched Oct 2023 (18 months ago - not "awaiting")
- £200K on unconfirmed inventory = poor planning
- If Netflix unavailable, where does £200K go? (Plan has no contingency)

**Should Be:**
- Either: Confirm Netflix availability NOW and include it
- Or: Allocate £200K to confirmed platforms (TikTok, Meta, Twitch)

**Red Flag:** Padding the plan with aspirational inventory vs confirmed buys

---

### 6. **CTV Over-Concentration = Single Channel Risk**
**Problem:** 71.4% on CTV means if CTV underperforms, entire campaign fails

**Scenarios Where This Breaks:**
- YouTube changes algorithm (ad fatigue, frequency caps tighten)
- ITVX viewing declines (summer = less catch-up TV)
- CTV CPMs spike (auction competition from other gambling brands)
- Creative doesn't work on lean-back format (CTV = passive, not action-oriented)

**Diversification Principle:** No single channel >30%, no single format >50%

**This Plan:** YouTube CTV alone = 28.6%, all CTV = 71.4% (dangerously concentrated)

**Better:**
- YouTube CTV: 15% (hero, not entire strategy)
- TikTok: 18%
- Meta: 15%
- ITVX + C4: 20%
- Programmatic + Audio + Other: 32%
= No single channel >20%, no format >40%

---

### 7. **Missing Platforms = Missed Opportunities**
**Not in the plan:**
- **Twitch** (1.5M UK gamers, live streaming, slots category exists)
- **Snapchat** (12M UK users, Age 18-34, AR lenses for game demos)
- **Reddit** (gaming subreddits, r/UKGambling = 45K members)
- **Podcast/Audio** (Only Spotify, but missing Acast, BBC Sounds gaming podcasts)

**Why Missing?**
- Agency doesn't have relationships (CTV = easy buys, Twitch = specialized)
- Creative isn't ready (Twitch needs streamer integrations, not just pre-roll)
- Risk aversion (comfortable with TV-like formats)

**Opportunity Cost:** £500K on these platforms could deliver 15-20K NDPs at lower CPA than CTV

---

### 8. **No Testing Framework**
**Problem:** All £4.2M allocated, no testing budget

**Missing:**
- Creative A/B testing (is "For Fun's Sake" better than "Big Wins Daily"?)
- Channel mix testing (does TikTok 20% beat YouTube CTV 30%?)
- Geo testing (500 MSOA concentration vs national)
- Frequency testing (3 exposures vs 5 vs 7)

**Industry Standard:** 10-15% of budget for testing (£420-630K)

**This Plan:** 0% testing, 100% execution (assumes everything works first try)

**Better:**
- Month 1 (April): £1M testing (10 creative variants, 5 channel mixes, 3 geo strategies)
- Month 2 (May): £1.6M scale winners from Month 1
- Month 3 (June): £1.6M full scale + optimization

## 🎯 What an AI Audit Would Say:

**"This plan appears optimized for agency comfort (CTV = familiar, TV-like) rather than client outcomes (reaching mobile-first 'Spin Masters'). Key issues:**

1. **71.4% CTV allocation contradicts 'mobile-first' brief** → Should be 40% CTV, 40% mobile social, 20% other
2. **TikTok (6%) and Meta (7.1%) massively under-allocated** → Should be 18% and 15% respectively  
3. **Vague targeting ('Adults 18+')** → Need behavioral, geographic, lookalike precision
4. **£200K on unconfirmed Netflix inventory** → High-risk, no contingency plan
5. **No testing budget** → £420K minimum needed for creative/channel/geo validation
6. **Missing platforms** (Twitch, Snapchat, Reddit) → £500K opportunity cost
7. **'Brand safety' language suggests risk aversion** → Using safety as excuse for conservative allocation

**Recommendation:** Request revised plan with 40% mobile-first allocation, 15% testing budget, and precision targeting specs."

## What Questions to Ask Mediacom:

1. **"Why 71.4% CTV for a mobile-first audience?"** (Force them to justify with data, not gut)
2. **"Show me where 'Spin Masters' spend their media time - is it CTV or mobile?"** (Data accountability)
3. **"Why is TikTok only 6% when it's the #1 platform for Age 25-34?"** (Platform bias exposed)
4. **"What rebates or incentives does your agency receive on YouTube/ITVX buys?"** (Conflict of interest check)
5. **"Where's the testing budget? We're spending £4.2M on untested creative."** (Risk mitigation)
6. **"What happens to the £200K Netflix allocation if it's not confirmed?"** (Contingency planning)
7. **"Can you show CPA projections by channel, not just reach?"** (Performance accountability)
8. **"Why aren't we using our 175K existing player database for lookalike targeting?"** (Data usage)

---

## The Real Issue:

**Mediacom built a plan they're comfortable executing (CTV buys, TV-like formats, familiar partners) rather than a plan that reaches the target audience where they actually are (TikTok, Instagram, mobile YouTube).**

This is classic agency conservatism: **minimize their risk (stick to known channels) vs maximize client outcomes (reach the right people).**

**The TAU difference:** We audit for client outcomes, not agency comfort.
