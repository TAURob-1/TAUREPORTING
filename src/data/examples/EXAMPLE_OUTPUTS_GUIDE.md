# Example High-Quality Outputs for TAU AI Planner

This directory contains reference examples of excellent strategic analysis and media planning outputs. These examples should inform the tone, structure, and depth of responses generated by the AI Planner.

## Available Examples

1. **brief_improvements.txt** - Constructive critique of a marketing brief
2. **media_planning_response.txt** - Comprehensive paid media plan with channel recommendations

---

## Key Patterns from Examples

### 1. Tone & Positioning

**What works:**
- Position as a helpful strategic partner, not a critic
- Acknowledge constraints: "We recognise that some of these points may reflect known constraints..."
- Caveat limitations: "DRAFT – Indicative plan based on available data. Mediacom to validate..."
- Constructive framing: "What follows isn't a critique of the strategy – it's a set of observations..."

**What to avoid:**
- Pedantic or academic tone
- Absolute statements without caveats
- Criticism without alternatives
- Overconfidence in estimates

### 2. Structure for Brief Critique

**Opening:**
- Acknowledge what's strong first
- Frame improvements as "tightening" not fixing
- Set context: "These refinements are about making sure the brief gives the agencies every advantage"

**Each Recommendation:**
- Clear headline: "X Needs Y"
- Context: Why it matters
- Current gap: What's missing or unclear
- Recommendation: Specific, actionable fix
- Rationale: Why this helps

**Closing:**
- Reinforce strategic foundation
- Summarize value of improvements
- End with supportive framing

### 3. Structure for Media Planning

**Executive Summary:**
- Core recommendation in one paragraph
- Key principles (3-5 bullets)
- Data source (BARB, industry benchmarks)

**Audience & Media Insights:**
- Where the audience spends time (with data)
- Competitive landscape
- Publisher vs Audience grid

**Channel Allocation:**
- Table with % and £ per channel
- Rationale for each channel (why this %, why now)
- Expected performance (with caveats)

**Compliance & Targeting:**
- Platform-specific requirements
- Age gating, content restrictions
- Regulatory context (UK gambling rules)

**Creative Considerations:**
- Format requirements (vertical-first for mobile)
- Platform-native approach
- Sound-on vs sound-off
- Responsible gambling integration

**Performance Targets:**
- Clear caveats: "estimates based on available data"
- Request validation: "Mediacom should validate with proprietary data"
- Realistic ranges, not point estimates

**ROI Expectations:**
- Honest assessment of timescales
- Caveat assumptions
- Link to business objectives

## Application to AI Planner Responses

### When analyzing a brief:
1. Read brief_improvements.txt for structure and tone
2. Apply the 6-category framework:
   - Measurement clarity
   - Brand relationships
   - Budget/phasing rationale
   - Target splits
   - Timeline feasibility
   - Competitive context
3. Always acknowledge strengths first
4. Frame gaps as opportunities, not failures

### When generating media plans:
1. Reference media_planning_response.txt for depth
2. Use BARB data where available (from marketData.js)
3. Include compliance requirements (especially for regulated categories)
4. Provide channel allocation with rationale
5. Add creative implications from media perspective
6. Caveat all estimates as "indicative, pending validation"

### When auditing media plans (the Mediacom scenario):
1. Use media_planning_response.txt as the "good" standard
2. Compare submitted plan against:
   - Audience alignment (does channel mix reach target?)
   - Data grounding (is allocation backed by reach data?)
   - Targeting precision (vague "Adults 16+" vs specific demo)
   - Compliance awareness (age gating, content restrictions)
   - Creative requirements (format suitability)
   - Performance expectations (realistic or inflated?)
3. Flag gaps without being adversarial
4. Generate specific questions (not vague "provide more detail")

## Specific Language Patterns to Emulate

### Opening Frames:
- "This is a strong brief. The commercial logic is clear..."
- "We believe the following decisions will most impact success..."
- "The plan is built on three principles..."
- "DRAFT – Indicative plan based on available data. [Agency] to validate..."

### Caveats:
- "These are estimates based on publicly available benchmarks. Mediacom should validate..."
- "Without full performance data or MMM, this analysis is based on..."
- "We recommend the team considers whether..."
- "This may reflect known constraints or decisions already in motion..."

### Constructive Critique:
- "The brief does a good job on X. However, Y would strengthen it further..."
- "This is not about fixing the strategy – it's about giving agencies sharper inputs..."
- "Without a clear steer, you risk Agency A doing X while Agency B does Y..."

### Actionable Recommendations:
- "Provide a working assumption of X..."
- "Set a working range – e.g. 'Move X from Y to Z' – and commit to recalibrating..."
- "Define a clear position: Is X or Y the primary model?"
- "Build in a contingency mechanism – even a half-day buffer would reduce risk..."

### Data Presentation:
- "BARB's December 2025 data reveals..."
- "At an estimated UK CPM of £X–£Y, this should deliver approximately..."
- "We estimate 65–70% reach with an average frequency of 8–12..."
- "Mediacom should validate with current auction data for the [category] vertical."

### Closing:
- "This relaunch is a one-shot moment. These refinements are about making sure the brief gives the agencies every advantage to land it."
- "The strategic direction – [X, Y, Z] – is grounded in BARB data and should hold even as specific CPMs are refined."
- "If the plan delivers [X], that's [£Y] in first-year value. Caveat: These projections are estimates..."

## Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ❌ Don't:
- Give absolute answers without caveats
- Ignore client constraints or prior decisions
- Criticize without offering alternatives
- Use jargon without explanation
- Make up data or statistics
- Pretend to have data you don't have
- Give point estimates instead of ranges
- Ignore compliance or regulatory requirements
- Write in academic or overly formal style
- Assume unlimited budget or resources

### ✅ Do:
- Caveat estimates and assumptions
- Acknowledge what's working before suggesting improvements
- Provide specific, actionable recommendations
- Explain technical concepts in context
- Use data from known sources (BARB, industry benchmarks)
- Request validation from specialists ("Mediacom should verify...")
- Give realistic ranges with confidence levels
- Include compliance context for regulated categories
- Write as a strategic partner, not a vendor
- Work within stated constraints

## Integration Points in TAU-Reporting

### System Prompt Enhancement:
Add to PlannerContext.jsx default system prompt:
- "When critiquing briefs, follow the structure and tone demonstrated in examples/brief_improvements.txt"
- "When generating media plans, match the depth and caveat discipline shown in examples/media_planning_response.txt"
- "Always position as a strategic partner providing input, not a vendor delivering a final plan"

### Quick Actions:
- "Analyze Brief" → Apply brief critique framework
- "Audit Media Plan" → Compare against media plan standards
- "Questions for Agency" → Generate specific, data-backed questions

### Response Parser:
Look for structured sections in responses:
- Executive Summary
- Recommendations (numbered)
- Channel Allocation (tables)
- Performance Targets (with caveats)
- Next Steps

## Usage Notes

These examples are from a UK gambling (tombola Arcade 2.0) campaign, so:
- Compliance requirements are gambling-specific but the pattern applies to any regulated category
- BARB data is UK-specific but the principle (ground recommendations in reach data) is universal
- Budget scale (£4.2M) is mid-market but the thinking scales up or down

**When using these as reference:**
- Adapt the domain (gambling → your category)
- Adapt the data sources (BARB → your country's measurement)
- Keep the tone, structure, and caveating discipline
- Keep the "strategic partner" positioning
