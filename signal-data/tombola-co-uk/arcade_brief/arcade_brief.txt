Key considerations 
 – 
what are we worried about? 
Classification: Internal
 31•
(re)launching arcade into a landscape which already has 400+ casino brands means that we need to be smart with our spend 
and how we show up. 
•
The tax increases in April mean that some of our LTO competitors will exit the market, we want to be able to take that market  
share and attract Spin Masters to the new arcade product.
•
To cut through in this space we need to drive higher awareness & consideration scores.
•
To do this job well, we need to develop a detailed understanding of the Spin Masters audience we are trying to target, 
specifically things like their habits, motivations, the key gaming moments for them etc, so we can target them with the right  
creative, media & social/PR approach.
•
Relaunching arcade to the market can only happen once, and we need to land it perfectly so that we can build on initial 
performance for the remainder of 2026. This requires careful alignment between and across the tombola business and agencies, 
so we need to work through how to implement this in April

Our key focus areas for this brief 
Think about how you will drive success in 
leading change across our 4 key imperatives
To deliver optimum results we need to be 
consistent in our strategy and execution
Where possible, building on past successes 
and into future plans...
1)
 Communicating 
 tombola as the spark of 
fun that puts the spark back in people's 
day through For Fun’s Sake
 - 
B&S to 
lead
2)
 Reaching Spin Master audiences
 - 
EMC 
to lead
3)
 Carving out arcade’s role in culture
 - 
That Lot to lead
4)
 Creating a sense of playful competition 
at every touchpoint to attract players to 
stay and play 
 - 
tombola to lead
Arcade currently drives around 43% of total 
UK monthly NGR and brings in 100
 -
150k 
active players each month. 
This has been achieved with zero dedicated 
marketing investment or focus for the past 
eighteen months. Despite that, we’ve built a 
loyal base with strong ARPUs that gives us a 
solid foundation to grow from in 2026.
The upcoming repositioning gives us a real 
opportunity to unlock incremental revenue 
by reaching a new player audience while 
continuing to nurture and energise our 
existing 
 playerbase
 .
Arcade relaunch gives us the opportunity to 
reposition ourselves as a challenger brand in 
a crowded market with content players can’t 
get anywhere else
We need an effective toolkit that illustrates 
our creative approach and message hierarchy 
giving examples of how that can be applied 
across all platforms in the most common 
formats 
We need one plan, that gives the business 
line of sight to all consumer facing comms 
across all touchpoints, demonstrating 
synergy of creative and messaging for new 
and existing players
We need creative that signposts itself as 
identifiably & distinctively tombola, that 
communicates our key differentiators

3: Practical details and considerations 
Classification: Internal
 34
Key considerations to keep top of mind
What media channels are we looking at using? 
Any must haves? 
Deliverables and production details  
We should prioritise channels that naturally attract younger audiences and give us efficient reach. With a limited 
budget, linear TV is not viable, so the focus should sit with digital. Programmatic is a strong performer for this 
demo, and delivering comms across at least three touchpoints will help drive consideration. Social, short
 -
form 
video, YouTube, and high impact placements on youth
 -
skewing platforms should also be explored to maximise 
relevance and frequency.
We need our limited spent to work harder in creative to achieve fame and fluency in advertising & drive brand 
recognition across our new audience. Demonstrate creative consistency across all channels
We know that core brand drives a halo for arcade, and we see benefits from increased spend 
 – 
how can arcade 
continue to benefit from the bigger budget and brand equity and take as much market share as possible across 
multiple audience?
We will need all deliverables and creative to be in the new branding and focused on our creative platform of For 
Funs Sake
